Puppies -

So here we have a very rare, well bred, lovingly home-raised, one-of-a-kind litter of Goldendoodle X Cockapoo puppies, affectionately known as the Cockadoodledoo. It’s a delightful fusion of these two beloved Doodle breeds.

By combining the friendly and intelligent traits of the Goldendoodle and Cockapoo, this breed is highly trainable and sociable. Both parents are renowned for their hypoallergenic coats, resulting in these Cockadoodledoo’s typically having low-shedding, soft fleecy, wavy to curly fur.

With moderate to high energy levels, these Cockadoodledoo puppies will thrive on regular exercise and mental stimulation. They are friendly, affectionate, and full of playful energy, making them an ideal family pet. Cockadoodledoos exhibit a gentle temperament, getting along famously with children, dogs and other pets.

Their sociability is a remarkable trait, allowing them to quickly form deep bonds with their owners. Unlike some breeds, they are not known for excessive barking. They are renowned for being eager to please and easy to train. With their easy trainability and gentle nature, a Goldendoodle X Cockapoo mix adds a touch of beauty and companionship to any family home.

These Cockadoodledoos will be raised in a loving home environment, socialised with adults, children, dogs, cats, handled daily and groomed. They will get lots of attention from me and my children e",Ben Roome,Hobby Breeder,14 Oct 2025,14 Oct 2025,BEN-76226,,,Yes,Yes,,,,7,6,1,,,"and all 7 babies are doing well, feeding and gaining weight.",,2026-01-19T08:37:04.420837

An umbilical hernia occurs when the muscle wall around the navel does not fully close after birth, leaving a small opening. If treatment is required, it is a routine procedure and can be repaired at the same time as spaying. For this reason, her price has been reduced accordingly to reflect the cost of the surgery.

We are incredibly proud to introduce our beautiful Cocker Spaniel puppies, born on 3rd December 2025, to our much-loved family dog.
These little ones have been surrounded by love from the very start and will be ready to join their new families on Wednesday 28th January, at 8 weeks old.

💖 Brought Up as Part of the Family - The puppies are being raised in our home with their wonderful Mum, and have been handled daily from birth. They are already used to the normal hustle and bustle of family life, including the hoover, washing machine, and television, helping them grow into confident, well-adjusted little companions.

🧬 Health & Peace of Mind - Both KC registered parents are here to meet (Pups not KC due to endorsements) and have been fully health tested clear for:

AON, AMS, DM, EIC, FN, PFK, and PRA.

You are very welcome to view copies of all health test certificates when you come to meet the puppies.

🩺 The Very Best Start- Before leaving for their new homes, each puppy will be:

Microchipped
Correctly wormed with Panacur 10% suspension at 3, 5, and 7 weeks
Flea treated prior to departure
Vaccinations can be arranged if required, though we would need to discuss the correct vaccination protocol due to different manufacturers and the potential complications of over vaccinating.

🎁 Thoughtful Puppy Pack- Each puppy will leave us with a carefully prepared puppy pack, including:

A scented blanket carrying Mum’s comforting smell
A supply of their regular food
Some of their favourite toys
Collar and lead
Written guidance covering feeding, grooming, vaccinations, and ongoing care
Ear cleaner
Further flea and worming treatment

🤍 Lifetime Support- We truly care where our puppies go. A lifetime of advice and support will always be available, as once one of our puppies leaves, they remain part of our extended family.

They are KC registered. Dad is fully health tested. Paperwork is available to see. I have two boys and now 1 girl for sale; all I can say is they are gorgeous. They are used to children of all ages, as we have children from 0 to 16 years old. A great family dog!

They are all so cute; they are growing so well. They are accepting of being touched and like to relax with you. Furthermore, they are starting to wean off from Mum and get used to the puppy milk I make for them.

An update about our girls and boys, as they have developed a lot. Both girls and boys are doing so well; they are walking already and trying to climb out of the whelping box, which the girls can do already. 😂 They are very playful and social; they like to be out and play with toys or each other. 😍 They are already going to the wee area that I have created in the whelping box. They are drinking sometimes from Mum, but can also drink water or puppy milk from a bowl. They are strong, independent pups slowly exploring the area they are living in. Furthermore, they like to be held and be petted. Not only that, but they are not afraid and are excellent with children. ❤️

Mum: Our Millie is a lovely dog. I must say she is a very caring dog; she was there for me when I was heavily pregnant and saw my youngest 2 growing up from birth. She grew up in a household with children of different ages; some of them have special needs. She is well-mannered, and she loves cuddles. Likewise, she enjoys going on trips and playing sports. She is a great, caring mum to her puppies, checking on them regularly and correcting them when needed.

This is a planned breeding and both parents have been selected specifically to create the perfect corso litter both aesthetically and temperament wise.
Pup will be ready to leave at 8 weeks old around the end of January.

Azura was bred and raised by BMN Corsos, her parents are BMN Bronson (UK bred from imported parents) and BMN Storm (imported from blue bloodline cane corso in Romania) both fully health tested and ICCF registered Corsos. They were selectively chosen to breed and azura was picked out of the litter to stay with BMN Corsos, she's been trained a high standard from day one and is a credit to the breed.
She has been raised with children and dogs, she's great with children and shows real loyalty to her family. Confident and happy in busy public settings and chilled out around the house, a perfect corso.
Kane is a huge corso imported from Serbia and has been raised and trained by elite corsos alongside their children, corsos and daschounds. He is fully health tested and his temperament is perfect, a real family corso he is your typical big loving boy. His parents are Hermes del nostro and Jamaica del nostro from Del Nostro Destino kennel. He is a bulletproof dog, confident and unphased in any environment, good with children and loves attention.
Both dogs are from fully health tested kennels and long lines of champions but most importantly healthy, good looking corsos with perfect temperaments.
With well documented instagrams for both kennels you can scroll through and see the raising of both parents along with looking back through the growth of pups from previous litters @bmn_corso @elite_corsos_

This playful Asian Toy Poodle is looking for a loving home and is ready to leave now.
Dad is Korean and mum is Chineese, which makes this puppy a VERY rare Asian Toy Poodle with all the perfect characteristics - short nozzle and legs, floppy ears, even red hypoallergenic coat and overall small size currently weighting only **** at 5 months old ! He has been health checked and has all of her vaccinations up to date and is ready for an owner that admires such a prestigious breed!

Toy Poodles are intelligent, affectionate, and eager to please, making them easy to train and deeply loyal to their families. They are playful and energetic without needing excessive exercise, and their adaptable nature makes them well-suited for various living environments, including apartments. However, they crave human interaction and may develop separation anxiety if left alone too long. Regular grooming, mental stimulation, consistent positive training, and early socialization are essential for keeping them healthy, happy, and well-adjusted. 🐩

Why choose this puppy ?
If you are committing to buying such a prestigious breed puppy, I am sure you looked all over the internet before seeing this beautiful boy. At 5 months old you see exactly what you are getting and there are no growth or characteristic surprises which you might get from a puppy that is only couple of months old and hasn't developed as much. As I'm sure you did your research and it is quite easy to tell that this puppy is a magazine cover quality Asian Toy Poodle which just shouts Luxury ! ✨️

There is no other such quality deep red colour coat Asian Toy poodle available in UK at the moment !

Feel free to contact and ask questions and arrange a video call or a physical viewing to see the pup 📲🐾

Here is Jude’s litter of KC registered puppies, specifically bred to be happy, healthy dogs well suited to all the adventures of being a valued family pet. Their KC registered parents are extensively health-checked and selected for their excellent temperaments; and the puppies have been carefully raised and socialised to give them the best possible start in life. Due to Christmas, we've taken these puppies further along their socialisation programme, carefully preparing them to join their new owners after the festivities.

We have one or two litters a year, we work from home, and Emma is a dog behaviourist. So we have put a great deal of care, attention and behavioural expertise in to preparing the puppies for their future life as family pets.

The puppies have been raised on our smallholding, and so are familiar with both home and outdoor environments. They have been taught to sit quietly on your knee, and understand that all four paws should be on the ground when they interact with humans. They have a reliable recall, and are learning to toilet in designated areas. They are confident, curious, and playful, and their individual personalities are starting to emerge.

We have taken great care to avoid any distress or over-excitement as we carefully socialise them to the life they can expect as family pets. Plus Emma will provide you with life-long behaviour and welfare support should you need it.

Their mum, Jude, is home-bred from our first litter. She is a fantastic dog: loving, trusting, super-intelligent, keen to get everything right, and always up for chasing a ball! She has passed the health tests required by the Kennel Club, and 19 of the 20 breed-specific DNA tests under the Embark scheme (plus a further 240 covering all DNA test for all dog breeds). Jude’s KC credentials can be found on the KC website under her Kennel Name Floshbeck Jude.

Puppies are full breed Maltese , although they will not be KC Registered, only forever family homes need apply. Maltese are highly affectionate, loving little dogs , and absolutely amazing with children and make great companions. Maltese puppies are hypoallergenic and don't shed, Ideal if anyone has allergies and can't have animals that shed hair, Maltese have an average life expectancy of 12-15 years, any potential owners need to be willing to commit and care for them for that amount of time. All owners need to be willing to let me visit to see where they will be going and ensure to an extent that they will be cared for and have appropriate veterinary care if it was ever needed. Puppies will be brought up in my family home with a large breed dog and young children, will be well socialised and loved throughout their short time with us. Only a couple of puppies will be available as we bred purely to add to our family from our own heathy, great tempered girl, and also so our large dog was aware right front he start that there would be puppies staying with us forever. Maltese require daily grooming to prevent matts forming, a groomer every 6-8 weeks will be required when they are older to keep your puppy in top condition and prevent any matts causing discomfort, I can recommend an amazing groomer which mum visits often for her groom. My puppies will be so loved here and I only expect the best for them , please PLEASE ONLY APPLY if you can offer the best loving home for these little beauties.

This is a planned breeding and both parents have been selected specifically to create the perfect corso litter both aesthetically and temperament wise.

Pups are expected 3/12/25 and will be ready to leave at 8 weeks old around the end of January.

Azura was bred and raised by BMN Corsos, her parents are BMN Bronson (UK bred from imported parents) and BMN Storm (imported from blue bloodline cane corso in Romania) both fully health tested and ICCF registered Corsos. They were selectively chosen to breed and azura was picked out of the litter to stay with BMN Corsos, she’s been trained to a high standard from day one and is a credit to the breed.
She has been raised with children and dogs, she’s great with children and shows real loyalty to her family. Confident and happy in busy public settings and chilled out around the house, a perfect corso.

Kane is a huge corso imported from Serbia and has been raised and trained by elite corsos alongside their children, corsos and daschounds. He is fully health tested and his temperament is perfect, a real family corso he is your typical big loving boy. His parents are Hermes del nostro and Jamaica del nostro from Del Nostro Destino kennel. He is a bulletproof dog, confident and unphased in any environment, good with children and loves attention.

Both dogs are from fully health tested kennels and long lines of champions but most importantly healthy, good looking corsos with perfect temperaments.

With well documented instagrams for both kennels you can scroll through and see the raising of both parents along with looking back through the growth of pups from previous litters @bmn_corso @elite_corsos_

The parents are from specially selected champion blood lines, from heavily titled championship lines combined with amazing health test results for several generations, ensuring we have produced the healthiest pups possible. Also to make sure these pups will grow to be strong and healthy we did a COI test on the parents to make sure there would be no inbreeding within the lines. COI stands for Coefficient of Inbreeding. The lower the score between the parents the healthier the pups. These tests can only be done on KC registered dogs. Polly (Dam) and Bear (Sire) scored an outstanding **** with the breed average being **** and **** being an indicator of genetic equivalence and as you can see there would be no chance with their low score. Since the puppies come from working stock, they cannot be compared to the show strain of Labrador Retriever that tend to be less agile, while having broader heads and deeper chests. The working strain of labrador tend to be extremely easy to train, whilst making loyal, biddable pets. The mother Polly (Lady Luna Selene) is an exceptional example of the breed. She has many FTCH in her lines including FT CH Tanyrhallt Blue Bloods and FT CH Drakesheads. She has the very famous FTCH Greenbriar Viper of Drakeshead in her pedigree lines. The Drakeshead kennel name is known for breeding very successful and healthy working type Labrador’s. Please note, her sire is on the champ dogs website and was fully health tested with amazing results and hip/elbow scores.

At Luxe Poms UK, we are passionate about producing some of the most beautiful, healthy, and well-socialised Pomeranians available in the UK.

Every one of our puppies is raised under our roof, with love, attention, and expert care – not in kennels or by third-party breeders.

We are proud to say that we own and care for all of our breeding dogs ourselves – including our two stunning bitches and our own exceptional stud. This means we have complete control over every stage of the breeding process, from carefully planned matings to the nurturing of our litters. Because no outside stud dogs are used, we can confidently stand behind the genetic integrity, health, and temperament of every puppy we produce.

We have two litters, 3 from one of our Pure White bitches and 2 from our other Pure White bitch.

We own the stud.

Our Pomeranians are fully Kennel Club registered, with all the paperwork and documentation to prove their lineage. What truly sets us apart is that these puppies are currently the only Pomeranians advertised on the Kennel Club website that meet the very high standard of “Sire meets the Kennel Club Best Practice Health Standards.” This designation is a mark of quality and responsibility, and it assures our buyers that our breeding practices meet or exceed the strictest welfare and health requirements.

Health and Wellbeing First

Every breeding is meticulously planned with health, structure, and temperament as the top priorities.

We’re proud to introduce a truly rare and exceptional litter of Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies, born 15th August 2025. These puppies are bred from carefully selected parents with outstanding bloodlines, full health testing, and a commitment to preserving the breed’s future — in both appearance and genetic health.

✅ Available Now:

1 Blenheim Boy

1 Blenheim Girl
1 Tricolour Girl

🔬 Why This Litter Stands Out – **** COI (Coefficient of Inbreeding)

Most Cavaliers in the UK today have extremely high COIs, often well above 10% — significantly increasing the risk of inherited health issues.
This litter has a verified COI of just ****, thanks to the importation of new bloodlines and highly selective breeding.

This is one of the lowest COIs you will find in the UK — a huge step toward reducing inbreeding and promoting long-term health and vitality.

If you're serious about the breed and want a healthy, responsibly bred puppy, this is the type of litter you want to invest in.

🐾 About the Parents:

Dam: Petite Tri-colour import, daughter of a Maltese Champion and Crufts entrant. Small, elegant, and sweet-natured.

Sire: Show-winning UK male, son of CH Pascavale Haiden. Stunning head shape, long ears, and a beautiful rich coat.

🧬 Both parents are fully health tested and clear of:

Dry Eye, Curly Coat, and Episodic Falling (DNA tested – clear)

Heart & Eye checks by specialist vets

No history or symptoms of SM (Syringomyelia) or related neurological issues

✅ Our 4 Breeding Goals:

Very low COI (****) for superior genetic health

Smaller Cavaliers – true to the traditional breed standard

Silky, rich coats in classic colours

Beautiful long ears – defining the true Cavalier look

The puppies have been carefully raised in our busy family home, surrounded by children, dogs, and everyday life, which means they are confident, outgoing, and well socialised. They are handled daily, introduced to different sights and sounds, and given the very best start, setting them up perfectly for their future roles.

At present we have two boys available, both strong, healthy, and showing fantastic temperaments. They are bold and inquisitive, yet affectionate and people-focused, with the classic trainable nature you would expect from these bloodlines. With their breeding, they will excel in working homes or active family environments, combining ability, temperament, and style.

The dam, Huntonsdoch In For A Penny (“Bonny”), is a stylish, intelligent working bitch with a sweet nature, used regularly in the shooting field and equally happy as a family companion. She has an excellent temperament — biddable, kind, and hardworking. Bonny has a hip score of 5:4, elbow score of 0:0, unaffected eyes, and is DNA clear for CNM, EIC, HNPK, prcd-PRA, SD2.

The sire, FTCh Jarailstar Hogen of Stauntonvale (“Brae”), is one of the most accomplished Labradors in the country. He became a Field Trial Champion at just two years old, has qualified three times for the International Gundog League Championship (2023), and is a member of the England Gundog Team. In 2025, he won both the CLA Challenge Trophy for highest scoring retriever and the Wilson Challenge Trophy for highest scoring dog overall at the CLA Game Fair International Team Gundog Competition.

We are pleased to offer 9 beautiful Golden Retriever puppies from the first litter of our dog Bella, born on November 27th. We have 5 males and 4 females available.

Both parents are perfectly healthy. The father is a dog known for his friendly socialization with children and other animals, and excellent learning abilities. Bella is our beloved, affectionate dog, very intelligent and loving with family and friends. We are raising the puppies at home with the love of both their canine parents and ours, so they are well-prepared to start their new life with their new family. We are with them 24/7, so they receive constant care, attention, and early socialization.

They are already exposed to a wide range of household sights and sounds, as well as everyday family life, giving them an ideal start and helping them grow into confident and well-balanced puppies.

The puppies will come with:
A comfort blanket with their mother's scent
A pack of puppy food
Microchip documents
A certificate of their first vaccination and medical check-up

( please read my profile for more information on parents and environment) i have also had to put english bulldog as the options are not there for Standard bully breed which is what mine are and both parents are standards also. mums parents are XL (bitch) and pocket (dog) bullys so she is a standard and pups are 100% standards.
there mother is 2 years old and this is and will be her only litter. she is a very attentive mother and great temperament in general, very intelligent and already showing to have passed this trait on to the pups as already a little fast on the milestones with one wagging his tail and one walking more than a step or two. these will be wonderful additions for any family especially if they are like there parents (dad also has great intelligence ) these pups will be having a great start in life and i hope to find people who will have the the same dedication as my family to continue their journey. they will be microchipped and vet checked and first vaccinations before leaving us. i will not be likely to let them go before 12 weeks however if my bitch gets fed up slightly before then the plan may change, however as i have stated i plan for 12 weeks before they are rehomed.",kelly,Hobby Breeder,25 Oct 2025,25 Oct 2025,KEL-17184,,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,,,,5,,,was in shock and staying away from her. i had to get her out of the sac and encourage mum to help an,also has great intelligence ) these pups will be having a great start in life and i hope to find peo,2026-01-19T08:52:10.770477

They have been raised in a home environment and are already comfortable around people, enjoying human company just as much as interacting with other dogs. They are affectionate, playful, and alert, showing the typical friendly and social Husky temperament.

Each puppy has been given a call sign inspired by their individual physical characteristics and personality associations: Ridgeline, Bullseye, Lone Wolf, Chowhound, and Cobra. These names help distinguish their unique traits while they grow and develop.

Some of the photos in this listing show the puppies at a younger age than they are now. At present, all puppies have fully upright, alert ears, and they have almost completely transitioned to puppy food, with nursing occurring only very occasionally for comfort.

For clarity, the photos in this listing are organised as follows:

Photos 1–9: Ridgeline

Photos 10–18: Bullseye

Photos 19–27: Chowhound

Photos 28–36: Cobra

Photos 37–45: Lone Wolf

Photos 46+: Additional photos of the mum and dad, as well as the puppies when they were younger

The puppies will turn 8 weeks old on 18 January 2026. During that week, they will receive their basic first vaccinations and their respective microchips, in line with responsible rehoming practices. They will be ready to join their new families shortly after.

We are delighted to offer our healthy, playful Siberian Husky puppies, raised in a loving family home.

Mum is 4 years old and comes from a KC family line, however she was never registered as she was purchased solely as a family pet, not a breeding dog. After careful consideration and recommendation, we decided to go ahead with a planned stud mating, which has had a very positive effect on her wellbeing and behaviour. Mum will be spayed after this litter to help prevent future health issues.
She is an incredibly kind, loving dog, excellent with children, very well trained, and can walk off the lead. She loves long walks and bike runs and has a calm, loyal temperament.

Dad is a 4-year-old purebred Siberian Husky, strong build, playful, affectionate, and fantastic with children.

Both parents are family dogs, raised alongside children and well socialised.

About Siberian Huskies:
Huskies are known for their friendly nature, intelligence, and loyalty. They are energetic, loving companions who thrive in active families and form strong bonds with their owners.

Puppies:
• Healthy, happy, and playful
• Raised in a family environment
• Vaccinated
• Health checked
• Microchipped
• Ready to go to their forever homes in 2 weeks

Two of the puppies have now been reserved, we are looking for 2 homes to give these puppies the wonderful lives they deserve. Two cream females are available.

Petal is a 3 year old cream miniature dachshund who is our family pet. She is the most gentle natured, cuddly pup who lives happily alongside our other dogs.

Brodie, the stud, is a shaded cream long haired miniature dachshund. He also has a beautiful temperament, hence choosing him to mate with our Petal. He is fully health checked and is PRA clear.

Puppies will be microchipped, vaccinated (if desired), wormed and well handled. Happy to answer all puppy related queries.

Petal has never had any health concerns and she is a lovely, lovely pet- hence deciding to breed from her. You will be able to meet Petal upon viewing.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch with any further questions, or to arrange a viewing. Petal and the pups will be available to be seen for serious enquiries only.

Petals will be sold with a puppy pack to help settle your beautiful puppy into your new home.

Xena: xena is just a little pocket rocket, she is so so sweet and absolutely loved people, I feel xena would thrive in a home with children purely because she comes out of her shell more when with them. She is very clever and loves to run circles around you😆
Thor: Thor is just amazing bless him, he is just so so sweet and will do anything for a cuddle and I mean anything😆 he is extremely playful however he adapts to surroundings quite well so he can be calm when he needs/wants to be.

All pups are socialised with children as young as 1!

All pups are socialised with cats however they can be quite in their face trying to play as they’re similar sizes.

They have took part in a puppy yoga weekend to help with their socialisation and understanding of new noises smells and environments.

All pups are used to car rides and actually rather enjoy them😂

These puppies will grow to be large dogs! I’m tired of seeing people taking in these breeds of puppies and rehoming them when they get too big. Both of their parents weigh around 40/50 kgs and are very strong. Training is a big factor with these pups and I am more than happy to help with further training for my babies!

Known for their foxy faces, ‘smiley’ features and luscious coats – not to mention that distinctive mane-like ‘ruff’ – their bushy tail completes the picture they also make great watch dogs.

The tri-colour pattern in Poms is the presence of ""tan points"" (markings that appear above each eye like eyebrows, on the muzzle, chest, legs, feet, and under the tail) combined opplwith a white ""parti"" (partially colored) base coat.
Due to the various ratios and shades possible with these colors, each tri-coloured Pomeranian puppy has a unique appearance like no other.
There is so much to love about the Pomeranian personality. Intelligent and attentive, they are always up for interaction with their owners, so are a lot of fun to have around. They have a maximum height of just 12 inches, the Pomeranian doesn’t need tons of exercise and will adapt well to most home set-ups.
