Liberty is around 10-11 months old. She is beautiful brindle colour and has a very affectionate and playful personality. Unfortunately due to me and my ex partner separating I cannot keep her as I cannot keep up with walks and training on my own. Liberty has a beautiful personality. She is very playful and a complete goof ball. She is not aggressive at all however she will need a home that can give her the time to train her and walk her. She will not do well in a home with cats.

He is affectionate, follows his person closely, and wants to be near his humans at all times. However, Axel is an anxious dog and is struggling significantly in a busy household environment. Since coming into my care it has become clear that his needs are beyond what I can provide, and this decision is being made purely for his welfare. Behaviour & Challenges: • Fearful of other dogs • Very sensitive to noise, movement, and change • Likely suffering from anxiety-related marking / stress toileting • Not coping in a busy or unpredictable home environment What Axel Needs: Axel must go to: • A very calm, low-stimulus home • Ideally adult-only • No other dogs (or an extremely experienced handler who can manage separation safely) • Someone with experience of anxious or reactive dogs • A home with hard flooring initially • Someone willing and able to work with a qualified behaviourist • Time, patience, and emotional consistency He is not suitable for: • First-time dog owners • Busy households • Homes with lots of visitors • Homes expecting a house-trained dog immediately Important Notes: Axel is not a “bad dog”. His behaviours appear to be driven by anxiety and overwhelm, not spite or lack of intelligence. In the right environment, with the right support, he has the potential to settle and improve. This is a heart-breaking decision and I am committed to ensuring Axel goes to the right home, not just the quickest one."

Mr Red has been raised in a family home; with 2 resident dogs and 2 cats. Mr Red loves to play, he is an extremely affectionate puppy who loves a cuddle and a fuss! He would make a great family pet, with either other dogs to play with or as an only fur baby so he can have all the love he deserves. He has all the classic cocker spaniel traits! He has been introduced to children, everyday activities and has been thriving over the past 8 weeks. He has been exposed to household noises like the hoover and the sound of fireworks. He is fully weaned and is currently toilet training. He has not had his tail docked and has received worming treatment every 2 weeks. Yellow: Boy - RESERVED Brown: Boy - RESERVED Blue: Boy - RESERVED Green: Boy - RESERVED Pink: Girl - RESERVED Purple: Girl - RESERVED Red: Boy Orange: Boy - RESERVED Both mom and dad are family pets, with sweet lovable temperaments. They are relatively calm in the home and burn off steam when out in the local fields. They love house guests and will both be here when viewing the puppies. Mom has been 10/10 throughout and we are so proud of her! They are working cocker spaniels by breed but not nature, meaning they haven’t worked a day in their life and although I’m sure they’d give it a good go.. they love sofa cuddles! The puppies have been extremely well cared for and are already much loved; therefore, choosing the right homes is important to us. We are looking for committed, responsible owners who are prepared to provide a lifelong home. Each puppy will leave with: - Health check - 1st Vaccinations - Microchip - 4 weeks pet insurance - Puppy pack with goodies and all relevant documentation For further information or to arrange a viewing, please feel free to make contact. Please note, there is a £250 deposit required to secure your chosen puppy."

It has nothing to do with Nala it is the fact that is a sudden change in the house with my illness and at the moment she’s spending more time in her crate since she is out with the family and it is no life for her she deserves the absolute world. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BELOW!!!! Now there are things that you should know going to be very honest with you she needs to go to a home without other animals especially dogs and cats. She will go for them when she gets walked every day twice a day she has to have a muzzle on, but if someone something goes for her, she will snap back now we’ve had her for 2 1/2 years. She has never once growled at any of us let alone bite or nip. I have four children here but when someone lets her out to take for a walk or anything else she is extremely excitable so younger children I wouldn’t recommend because she will knock them over. She gets very excited. She jumps up and then she lays on the floor and she waits to have her belly rubbed and she should stay there all day laying on her back, just waiting for people to come and rub her belly, We have four cats Adult cats they are older and we didn’t know about cat situation when we got Nala or any other information about Nala but if to let Nara out and to take for a walk, we have to put all four cats into another room to let Nala out so she can go for a walk or go and play in the garden then let the cats back out so they can roam around the house cause they house cats and then same again bringing her in. She can’t be let off her lead at the park. I have tried three dog groomers, two of which rang me within 20 minutes of dropping her off because she was going crazy cause obviously though other dogs in the background so I’ve had to Fatch her the last lady she does it after all the other dogs have been collected She has recently been defleed and wormed. Now the price reflects on how comfort we are that Nala will be looked after she is very loving. She will try and sit on your lap and think that she’s a baby but she’s not. She’s extremely heavy, we want a family or a a couple perhaps someone that’s at home all day because she will be able to be out of her crate. I wouldn’t have to move her to get the cat out or anything cause she would make excellent company. I got diagnosed with MS and it has progressed quicker than we thought. I’m currently bed ridden and my husband is having to do everything and Nala is being left alone too much and it’s just not fair and it’s breaking our hearts. Even the children have agreed and she loved by so many. also to make sure she goes to a good Home ❤️ we would possibly do a Home ❤️ visit so we know that she’s going to be loved and have everything that not our love needs thank you for reading and hopefully there will be a loving Home ❤️. ** please note anyone who starts the message with “ I’ll give you £100”. or any other amount you will NOT get a reply it means you have no interest in taking her to a lovely home or serious about what’s been written **"

He's an intact 6.5yr old male german shepherd whom I've owned since 8 week pup so this is incredibly hard. He is a massive boy! Unfortunatley due to circumstances, safety and ensuring the best quality of life is received we are looking for somebody who will love Aslan like us! MUST BE AN ONLY PET/NO CHILD HOME - SIMILAR BREED EXPERIENCE OR TRAINING EXPERIENCE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUIT HIM. If you have high energy drive dog ownership experience or you have good training knowledge and can provide a calm environment then you may be perfect for Aslan. He is highly intelligent loves to run and chase his ball for hours, very ball driven for training and calm and cuddly on his own! He is crate trained & never disruptive or destroys in the house at all. He absolutely loves his food too! A long walk or run will only get him sleeping for a short while so he needs some one able to give him a lot of daily time. Aslan has been anxious since a pup which we worked on however as our house gets busier and having to downsize home it appears to be taking a toll on him. He is dog reactive so is kept separate from our other dog which means his freedom is being compromised too. He gets on with our female dog but when she gets hyper it triggers him and same with the kids he is fine with them often prefers to play ball with them but when they get loud or hyper he starts pacing in circles which is his tell sign or barking/yapping. Because of this he is best as an only pet & without children for safety precautions. Sadly we are having to make the decision to rehome him so he can thrive or keep him & his needs possibly continue to get worse as after trying different strategies and trying to manage our house is too much for him to handle and be comfortable in. He needs a sole person or a couple who can dedicate time, love, patience and the right training and he will reward you with so much. Despite his issues he really is the best boy struggling to navigate with a lot of love to give back! Its not a light hearted decision and we won't be rushing untill we find the best home for him which we hope any genuine interest will understand. Please get in touch for more information. We do not want to profit from him however would like to make sure he goes to a genuine home. If this is proven all payment will be returned as we just want the best for him."

He has always been in good health, with no medical issues, and has been well cared for. He’s a very playful dog who loves his tennis balls and enjoys long walks. He thrives outdoors and is happiest when he has plenty of space and exercise—the more activity, the better. He has always been an outdoor dog and would do best in a home with a good-sized yard or outdoor area where he can run and explore. He can be a bit nervous around new people at first, but once you engage him in play and give him time to warm up, he becomes friendly and affectionate. We’re hoping to find a home that understands the needs of an active German Shepherd and can provide him with space, exercise, and attention.

He is mostly black with brown on the back of the legs. He is all up to date with injections/flea and worming. He is neutered and microchipped. He is a friendly dog, but he has no idea what personal space is, he loves to snuggle into necks and follow you everywhere. He is very loyal to familiar people. He’s a very clever dog but he does need extensive training in some areas so I’d rather him go to a home who has the time for that and who has experience with the breed. He has grown up around a small child and a cat and he’s had no issues with them. He does however have issues in other areas. He is dog reactive on walks, he barks at them and pulls to be over to say hello, he’s never snapped or shown aggressive behaviour towards them, he’s just a very curious dog. If a stranger is walking near, he will try to jump up at them if they’re close enough. If you leave anything lying around, he will find a way to get into it. (Bin bags, any kind of plate/cup in the sink etc even if he’s just been fed.) German shepherds are a very vocal breed, and Atlas is no stranger to barking if someone walks past the window, gets out of a car on the street etc. I need him to go to a home who has the time, patience and space for him to thrive and where his needs are met.

They’re already very well socialised and playful with people (including children) and other dogs. All puppies will leave with a puppy pack, care guide, fully flea treated and wormed. A deposit of £250 will secure your puppy. Any questions you may have at all, please get in touch."

We love the experience of having a litter and you can be assured that these puppies will have the best start to their lives. We had this litter so that we can keep one ourselves so there’s a lot of excitement in our household! Puppies will be exposed to lots of household noises (the TV, the hoover, the blender etc), brought up with children (we have 4 children), will be well socialised and used to being around other dogs and animals (we have sheep and hens). They will very much be in the centre of our house for their first few weeks with us, living in our country kitchen with people around at all times. They are showered with love and cuddles almost constantly. The pups will be ready to leave for their new homes from the beginning of February following their eight-week final vet checks, vaccinations and microchips. They will join their new homes with the following: • Microchip and information pack • Vaccination card & worming record • Lifetime support and advice • A contract of sale for your peace of mind Given the unfortunate rise of dog thefts, we would like to point out that someone is at home 24 hours a day with the puppies and our grounds are covered by CCTV.

Absolutely lovely with children, she’s been brought up with children from them being newborn. She can sometimes be quite bouncy and energetic so she does need someone who can either give her long walks or somewhere to run but this is expected with the breed she is. She can do basic commands sit, down, paw, side, bed etc. she’s fully house trained. She is going through a tendency to pull on the lead at the minute which she never used to do but with basic persistent training she’d be out of it in no time. She’s an absolute breeze to train with and catches onto new command easy and absolutely loves it. She’s great with other dogs but isn’t a fan of cats. Looking for £100 just so she isn’t going to anyone but would be open to any offerers for the right person as her going to a good loving home is more important. She’s chipped and up to date with her vaccinations, flea and worming. Thank you ☺️"

I've only had time wasters so far** Ares is a 18 month old puppy, who I've had since he was 8 weeks old. He's full of personality and life, affectionate and very curious. He is a darling dog, and it pains me to have to rehome him, but there are a few behavioural issues that I've tried to manage myself, but am not making headway. Ares is my first dog, and I can't afford a trainer. In short, I'm not experienced enough with dogs to provide him with what he needs. He barks a lot, particularly for attention, so I've been leaving the room when he does and paying him attention when he's quiet, which has helped slightly, but not solved the issue. He wants to be outside constantly, and I don't have a garden myself. Due to having no garden, he is not fully potty-trained. He knows to go outside, but if I'm not home to let him out, he will still soil indoors, and not hold it like he should. He has a lot of energy and needs to go out for walks as often as possible. What he needs in a future owner: He needs someone who has experience with dogs and training, and I know he would benefit from the mental stimulation that comes with the training. He needs someone who has a garden or access to an outdoor space as much as possible. He needs someone who has a more active lifestyle than me, who will be able to take him with them as much as possible. I really am quite sad that I have to admit that I can't provide him what he needs, and I have given it my all, but it is now affecting my mental health, and I know there must be someone out there who can do a better job than me. He is up to date with vaccinations, microchipped, and has been defleaed and dewormed recently. He comes with a crate, harness, flexi-lead, coat, toys, remaining food (Butchers, which is his preference and other foods give him a bad stomach), months of worming and flea medication, scratch box for his nails and other accessories."

Ziggy is a boxador (boxer X Labrador) He is playful, affectionate, and full of personality. Loves cuddles, playing outside, and being around people. Has been raised in a family environment and is great with children. Ideally looking for a family as he adores children! However we are open to other people as long as they have the time to commit to him. Please be mindful that he is still a puppy and it could take him some time to mature. He does like to chew things so he needs to have a routine and lots of walks to use up his energy. My whole family is devastated that we are having to rehome him but we know it’s the best decision for him. I want him to be in a home where he gets all the attention and love he needs and deserves. Asking for the price stated because we want to ensure he goes to an appropriate home and not just anyone. I consider him like one of my children and want the best for him. He gets on with other animals and is used to living with our 2 cats that he loves to pieces! Please get in touch if you have any questions & I’ll be happy to chat. Thanks"

After careful consideration and recommendation, we decided to go ahead with a planned stud mating, which has had a very positive effect on her wellbeing and behaviour. Mum will be spayed after this litter to help prevent future health issues. She is an incredibly kind, loving dog, excellent with children, very well trained, and can walk off the lead. She loves long walks and bike runs and has a calm, loyal temperament. Dad is a 4-year-old purebred Siberian Husky, strong build, playful, affectionate, and fantastic with children. Both parents are family dogs, raised alongside children and well socialised. About Siberian Huskies: Huskies are known for their friendly nature, intelligence, and loyalty. They are energetic, loving companions who thrive in active families and form strong bonds with their owners.

The genetic diversity within this litter ensures longevity by reducing the risk of health issues as a result of inbreeding - seen in pure breeds. Therefore these Cockapoo puppies are set up to live long, healthy and joyful lives. ❤️PARENTS: • Mum is our gorgeous red RKC registered Miniature Poodle. Her height: 14.8 inches to the shoulder, & Hypoallergenic. Mum has the most beautiful nature. She is incredibly loving, intelligent and full of personality, while equally very relaxed and easy-going. She adores her puppies, and is an exceptional mother to them. • Dad is a carefully selected, stunning red Miniature F1B Cockapoo. His height: 14.5 inches to the shoulder, & Hypoallergenic. Dad is a real character, and always happy to please! He is highly intelligent, eager to learn and very obedient. He also loves to play, which is perfectly balanced with his calm and gentle nature. 🧬HEALTH: • Mum is health tested CLEAR of the following (which can be carried in Poodles): ✅Progressive Retinal Atrophy (prcd-PRA) ✅Neonatal Encephalopathy (NE/NEWS) ✅Von Willebrand disease Type I (vWD I) ✅Gangliosidosis (GM2) ✅Osteochondrodysplasia • Dad is extensively health tested CLEAR of the following (which can be carried in Poodles or Cocker spaniels): ✅Progressive Retinal Atrophy (prcd-PRA) ✅Progressive Retinal Atrophy (rcd4-PRA) LOPRA ✅Neonatal Encephalopathy (NE/NEWS) ✅Degenerative Myelopathy (DM exon 2) ✅Von Willebrand disease Type I (vWD I) ✅Familial Nephropathy (FN) ✅Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) ✅Acral Mutilation Syndrome (AMS) ✅Examination of the Eye & Adnexa • Therefore the puppies will be UNAFFECTED by all of the diseases listed above. 🐶COAT TYPE - • These puppies are expected to have a curly/defined-wavy coat type - sharing both qualities of the tight Poodle curls, and the wavy Cockapoo coat. • They are hypoallergenic - as Mum is a purebred Poodle, and Dad (who is 3/4 Poodle) has spent time with a pet allergy sufferer, which caused no reaction/symptoms. 🪴UPBRINGING & CARE: Puppies will have experienced the following: • The introduction of toilet training from a very early age.

This is a rare opportunity to welcome a puppy from proven champion bloodlines, combining the best of Sorsha’s full Lion Type and Bruno’s powerful Tiger Type. Each puppy promises size, beauty, and a temperament that will make them a lifelong companion. Gentle Giants with Family-Friendly Temperament Both Sorsha (dam) and Bruno (sire) are calm, loving, and deeply affectionate. Despite their impressive size, they are used to children, highly sociable, and confident without being aggressive. We expect their puppies to inherit the same gentle, loyal nature, making them perfect for families prepared for a very large, majestic dog. Size, Presence & the “Lion Effect” Tibetan Mastiffs are not just big — they are truly captivating. Adults reach 60–70kg+, with heavy bone, broad heads, thick coats, and that unmistakable lion-like presence. People literally stop in their tracks. It’s almost impossible to walk one without hearing: “Oh my God… it looks like a lion!” They draw attention wherever they go — commanding admiration without being excitable, bold yet gentle, captivating and unforgettable. Meet the Puppies This litter is already showing incredible potential, with coats ranging from deep black to brilliant gold, and markings hinting at their future manes. While we can’t guarantee that all will have the full lion-like mane, each puppy will develop a beautiful coat, and some will have especially impressive manes as they mature around the 8- to 12-week mark. Each puppy is unique: • Black male – very large, striking white “number 7” marking on chest, white-tipped paws, early eyebrow markings • Black female – largest female, white chest markings, white-tipped paws, beautiful tan eyebrow accents • Black male – smaller, white star chest marking, white-tipped paws, extremely affectionate • Small black female – tiny, mostly black, sweet and delicate • Mid-sized black female – small white chest marking, shiny coat, very affectionate • Large gold female – rich, bright golden coat like her mother, likely long-haired lion type • Gold female – slightly darker gold, beautifully shaded coat, large and striking Coats, markings, and manes will continue to develop as they grow, with some puppies potentially showcasing particularly impressive lion-like manes around the 8- to 12-week mark. Health, Care & Responsible Homes These puppies are raised in a loving, hands-on environment, with thorough veterinary checks to ensure they are healthy and well-socialized. We are committed to finding responsible, loving homes for these gentle giants. These dogs are playful, loyal, and family-oriented, but they do require owners who are prepared for their impressive size and unique needs. Secure Your Puppy To ensure these puppies are placed in genuine, loving homes, we ask for a non-refundable deposit. This measure is not about money; it’s about ensuring that each puppy goes to a home that truly understands and will cherish them.

Both boys are so lovely and gentle, they love a cuddle and playing with their litter mates. We take socialisation seriously and strive for puppies to leave our home confident, curious, playful and ready to adapt to life in their new homes. Border Collies are intelligent so we make sure they get the right mental stimulation early on. Our pups will be well loved, regularly handled, gently introduced to new experiences, and exposed to sensory challenges. They will be well socialised and introduced to as many sounds and experiences as possible: household noises (vacuuming, music, etc), and other animals including cats, rabbits, reptiles and farm animals. They will have regular play inside, experience the world outside, have moments of independence, and will begin toilet training and basic commands whilst they are with us. Mum and Dad both have a friendly and lovely temperament, are hip scored and health tested. Both parents are on the smaller side for Border Collies, so we expect the puppies to be similarly sized. -MUM- Mum is our family dog — she comes from a local working sheep farm line and has herding in her blood.

These pups will need commitment, time and love every day, and we want them to go to homes ready for a lifelong family member. Before leaving for their forever homes, we have a contract in place and ask for a home check (via satisfactory video/photos) plus a short questionnaire to ensure each puppy is a good match for your family and lifestyle.

Rusty is an extremely loving, energetic, and family friendly bundle of joy. As per most cockapoo’s he gets extremely attached, this isn’t unusual at all with this breed so we would preferably like someone who has either had experiences with cockapoo’s or has done their research and will be able to provide the right care. Like most Cockapoo’s Rusty loves to carry stuff in his mouth. This is why the best kinds of treats for him are bones with meat or something else inside, because he loves to chew and carry things around.

We are looking for a very special home for our 2.5 year-old castrated Standard Schnauzer. He is a really good dog in so many ways: he is loving with us, intelligent, enjoys agility in the garden and is great at close heelwork, doing tricks etc. (see the videos of him doing agility in the garden and working on obedience moves in the hall). He’s also a good watchdog as he sounds the alarm when anyone approaches the house – though that can be annoying. At this stage, I expect you are asking what the problem is. Unfortunately, he does not get on with our 7-year-old cockapoo bitch and given the size difference we cannot risk any confrontation meaning that we live day to day with them in separate areas of the house, sharing our time with each of them. We are now at the stage of thinking that this isn’t sustainable. If that were the only issue, I’m sure re-homing him would be easy, but it isn’t just our other dog that he doesn’t get on with. He is also unpredictable with both strange dogs and people. He has never bitten anybody, but we take no risks and muzzle him when he is in public. When we have visitors, we put him in his crate only letting him out when he is quiet and settled – but it can still be very off-putting as he will not let strangers stroke him. We’ve soldiered on with him because we love and care about him, but we have to admit that he really isn't the right dog for our family. I think he would really suit someone who has time for him, has no other dog, and wants a constant companion to be with them most of the time. He is crate trained, muzzle trained (though he doesn’t like it), fully vaccinated and flea treated. He’s a complicated dog and not friendly to everyone. It'll take him some time to accept you and no doubt he'll be a nightmare until he settles but he is such a special dog that if you have the time, understanding and patience, he will be a friend for life."

The litter consists of four males and five females, all of whom are thriving and developing wonderfully. I now have 4 girls and 3 boys available The puppies are being raised in a loving family home and will continue to receive exceptional care as they grow. Regular updates and additional photographs will be available, and you are welcome to contact me via WhatsApp for further photos and videos. From an early age, the puppies are being carefully socialised in a busy household environment. They are regularly exposed to young children, including a child with additional needs, and will also be socialised with our other dog. Labradors are renowned for their friendly, loyal, and intelligent nature, making them outstanding family companions. Impressively, the puppies are already showing early signs of intelligence by using puppy pads at just two weeks old. We will also be undertaking sound desensitisation, introducing everyday household noises such as the vacuum cleaner, fireworks, and general day-to-day sounds, to help ensure the puppies grow into confident, well-adjusted dogs and reduce the risk of anxiety later in life. The mother, Narla, is our much-loved family dog. She has been raised alongside our male Golden Retriever and two children with special needs, one of whom is severely autistic. Narla has a truly outstanding temperament and shares an incredible bond with our children. She embodies everything desirable in the breed — beauty, unwavering loyalty, intelligence, strength, and a strong heritage of devotion and skill. The father is a KC-registered stud dog, known for his excellent intelligence and strength. Photographs of the sire are included. The puppies will be ready to leave at 8 weeks of age. Each puppy will be: • Fully vaccinated • Microchipped • Provided with a puppy pack, including food, toys, and a blanket carrying the scent of their mother and littermates to help them settle comfortably into their new home To secure your chosen puppy, a £300 non-refundable deposit will be required after you have viewed the puppies and are happy with your choice.

I would suggest an adult home with a sizeable garden would be best for her. She is clean in the house, not destructive, and loves her treats.

Female Labrador Retriever - Yellow (born 2016) She comes from fully health tested parents. and Is KC Registered. I have placed endorsements on her paperwork, and although you may see the papers if you wish. she will NOT be going to her new home with them. She suffers from an allergy- she sneezes and sometimes has a snotty nose. We have never had a Labrador with an allergy. We don’t know if it’s because we have farmland all around us – there is lots of dust/pollens and of course the farmer regularly sprays his fields. She is very friendly – sometimes boisterous. She likes to hold your hand in her mouth while you walk around the garden with her. She walks nicely on the lead, and of all the times she has encountered other dogs whilst out, she has only shown interest NEVER aggression. She has never been around children – and I would think an adult only home would be best for her. She gets quite excited when she is brought into the house, but settles down after half an hour or so. She loves treats but can get a little over excited when taking them. She doesn’t snatch, but sometimes your fingers end up in her mouth as well as the treat. When you show her the treat bag and say ‘sit’ most of the time she does so immediately. She is a lovely friendly dog and loves to chase a ball. Like her sister, she is being re-homed through no fault of her own."

Caesar is a big dog (50+kg) but is soft and loving, loves cuddles and fusses. Loves walks and is good on the lead - Halty or extendable only (no normal lead or collar or he will pull like a tank). Great with food and is not possessive!!. He is crate trained but is also great out of crate so can do either. Fantastic security dog and will keep your house secure (very good bark!) off the lead he is great however we tend to hire out private fields purely because other people don’t react well to him. He is good with other dogs and has lived with other dogs (German shepherd and cocker spaniel) he is neutered too. He is up to date with vaccinations, worming and flea treatments. He can also be left for a fair few hours and be ok. That’s all his great points. Now his few not so good points:He cannot be rehomed with YOUNG CHILDREN. And this is our reason for rehoming. He is great with older children but not too good with younger ones. He gets overwhelmed, we have a 4 year old now and he just can’t cope. It would be best for him to be with people or a person without children or with older children. His next negative, which we have under control, is he has an allergy to wheat and yeast (took us years to figure it out) so he is on special food (don’t cost too much!) but he cannot eat anything extra, if he does then his fur falls out and his skin flakes and becomes red swollen and flakey, also his ears become very sore and swollen too. So we just stick to his normal food for him and he is fine. Any treats have to be hypoallergenic. He is such a good dog and it is such a shame that we are having to do this but he will be a pleasure to someone else without children and he will be much happier. I can see it in him that our little one is stressing him out too much and it’s not fair on him or her. So please if you can offer him a kind loving home which he deserves please contact us for a meeting ??"

We have 2 other dogs too (1 x male and 1 x female) and Oscar has no issue with either. We have recently had a litter of 5 puppies too and Oscar was so playful and gentle with all of them. We have tried support from a dog behaviourist but he cannot seem to let go of his issue with the older dog. Outside he is friendly when approached by other dogs, walks well off the lead (when we go to playing fields and country walks), has good recall and is crate trained. Our thoughts are that Oscar needs to be in a home either alone, or where he would be the first dog in a home before others are introduced. He has never attacked or bitten the older frenchie but he is constantly watching his every move and blocks him from playing with any toys or with the other dogs. Aside from the negatives he is extremely loving and will often jump up next to me and go to sleep. He likes cuddles and chilling with a blanket. KC Paperwork is available"

She's a healthy 11kg and has lovely colouring - a complete symmetry of colour; predominately black but with white and ginger markings and has the floppiest ears and biggest paws!!! Bought on the 2nd January from a licenced breeder in Carmarthen (Malolgi Kennels - E.M. Roberts) (licence number: LAB107) - we can provide contact details for the breeder if necessary for clarification or you can easily find this information online. We spent months and months choosing the right puppy and right seller, but unfortunately due to our son having allergic reactions and our elderly cat becoming stressed and ill we have had to make the decision to rehome Bailey. Despite this hard decision we've decided to do it sooner rather than later before Bailey becomes to attached to us and it becomes harder for her to resettle in a new home. She came from a litter of 8 puppies and we saw Mam and Dad and the remaining litter and received a contract which the new buyer can have showing that the parents had a health check before breeding and the puppy received a health check prior to our purchasing. We saw the family that raised her and the lovely conditions they lived in. in addition to breeding dogs, they have a working farm where they breed and show livestock and clearly loved their animals. She has been microchipped and her vaccines and worming and flea treatment were up to date when we purchased her and Bailey will have her final booster injection on the 14/01/2026. She's very loving and has a lovely temperament and is very intelligent. She loves cuddles We've been working hard as a family to train Bailey and she's been taught to sit, lay down, wait, get down, and is well on the way to be toilet trained. She loves to play and has her favourite toys (which we'll provide of course) but also loves her down time. She is good at relaxing and sleeping during the day when put on her bed and at night now sleeps right through to the morning. She enjoys time in the garden, running around and exploring. She isn't bothered by loud noises; piano and musical instruments, hoovering, drilling, knocks on the door etc. she just ignores them and gets on with whatever she was doing. She's definitely not a 'barky' dog. She's loves her food and is primarily fed on Bergess Supa Dog Puppy (we'll provide any remaining food), but has been introduced to mince and also carrots and apples which are great for the teething. She also loves peanut butter on a Licky Mat. This a very reluctant and sad decision and sale; we've always wanted a puppy/dog as we're an outdoor family, but at the moment our son's health must take priority and it's important that Bailey has a loving family that can give her all the love and attention she deserves. We paid £1500 just 2 weeks ago and good £400+ on bedding, equipment, food, toys, injections etc. However to ensure a quick rehoming for Bailey to reduce any stress we are asking only £1200 which will include all of the following as well: All remaining Bergess dog food (we've only just bought a huge 12.5kg bag) lots of treats Collar, harness, lead and car seat harness 2 large beds All her toys etc. Sheet/towels with her smell to help her resettle You'll be given a copy of the contract we had from the licenced breeder we purchased Bailey from and her vaccination record and diet/health plan - and a contract/receipt of sale from us. You're welcome to visit Bailey here and see her in her new environment and we can answer any questions you may have. Just like you'll want to see our loving home before making a decision; we're absolutely gutted and feel really guilty and will only sell if we also feel happy and confident that Bailey will be loved and cared for. I hope this provides lots of initial information, but please do get back in touch with any questions or if you would like to come around and see Bailey. We're based in Porth, CF39 9AB Many thanks Delyth and David"

This will be her first and final litter. Cali is 4 years old and has produced a healthy litter of 9 puppies, with 5 still available and looking for their forever homes. The puppies are now almost 10 weeks old and are ready to leave. They are very healthy, growing well, and their personalities are developing beautifully. All puppies have been examined by our vet twice, most recently on 19th January, have received their first vaccinations, and have been given a clean bill of health. All puppies are microchipped, and ownership can be transferred within minutes. ⸻ About the Parents • Mum (Cali) – Our much-loved family dog, raised in a busy household with children ranging from young to teenage. She has a wonderful temperament: gentle, affectionate, patient, and well-mannered. She has been an excellent, calm, and nurturing mum, and her lovely nature is already clearly reflected in the puppies. • Dad – A huge boy at 62kg with an excellent temperament. He is friendly, affectionate, loyal, and great with other dogs. Although dad does not live with us, photos are available. ⸻ Puppies Available & Pricing • 5 girls currently available • Black girls – £700 each (3 available) • Orange collar (black girl) – £500 (priced to reflect a minor cosmetic tail bend only) • Brown girl – £700 (1 available) All prices reflect the puppies’ excellent health, home upbringing, veterinary care, microchipping, and first vaccinations. ⸻ Bent Tail Information One of the girls (orange collar) has a slightly bent tail. This was not present at birth and was noticed around day two. We believe this may have happened accidentally when mum sat on her, which can occasionally occur in larger litters. She has been examined by our vet twice, most recently on 19th January, who confirmed: • She is completely healthy • The tail bend causes no pain, discomfort, or toileting issues • It does not affect movement or development • No treatment is required ⸻ Upbringing All puppies have been raised in our loving family home and are handled daily. They are used to everyday household noises, children of various ages, and lots of affection. They are thriving, eating well, and developing into confident, happy puppies. ⸻ Viewings & Reservations Viewings are welcome and encouraged, as finding the right homes is extremely important to us. A £250 non-refundable deposit is required to reserve a puppy until collection. If you would like additional photos, personality descriptions, or to arrange a viewing, please don’t hesitate to get in touch. Photos show mum and dad."

He’s up to date with all vet care and is currently on a pet plan. He would thrive in a home with plenty of outdoor space where he can run, explore, and burn off his energy. He can be quite lively both in the house and garden, so regular exercise is really important for him. He absolutely loves his walks and benefits greatly from the freedom and stimulation they provide.

Puppy Details: • Three are white and merle, and one is slightly cream with a hint of merle (currently marked with a red collar; we may be keeping this little one). • All puppies were delivered naturally by their mother without complications. Previous generations have shown no health or breathing concerns, and all litters have been conceived naturally. • The puppies will be vet-checked, wormed, vaccinated, and microchipped before going to their new homes. Registration: • The puppies will be DWKC registered, not KC registered, due to the merle colouring. Serious French Bulldog enthusiasts will be familiar with this distinction. Early Interest & Reservation: • We are currently taking expressions of interest. • Deposits can be made to secure a puppy and a place on the waiting list, with full details provided as the puppies grow. These little boys are already showing sweet and affectionate personalities, and we are excited to find loving homes for them. Serious inquiries are welcome."

His name is Enzo and we absolutely love him to pieces, however we do have 2 border collies and the 3 dogs combined just do not get along. The 2 border collies that we have are male and female, the female tends to herd him relentlessly and the males end up having scuffles which is hard to manage for us. We are 21 and 22 years old and I (21 female) work full time and my partner (22male) works part time. We have a good schedule to ensure all 3 dogs are well exercised and are given lots of attention however recently it has been very difficult with the dogs not getting along. We want to see Enzo go to a loving home with people who will continue to put in the training with him. Enzo is very food driven which we have used to our advantage with training but it does mean you need to be firm with commands when feeding (sit, paw, wait). Enzo is a large shepherd, and he is not yet fully grown. We do have pictures of Mam and Dad from when we originally bought Enzo and they are also large GSDs, I am more than happy to send these over on request as I will have to have a little hunt for them. We feel he would thrive being an independent dog in a home with no other pets."

She does behave and loves being the centre of attention. Due to Angels past where she has been abused.

Angel weights 42kg, she is very strong, protective, vocal an all around guardian. Although currently Angel lives with another dog her size who she bully’s and two cats who she respects and co exists with. I think it would be all around better if she had all the attention on her. While Angel gets along and lives with other animals she does not like strange animals in public or in her space. She does not like other dogs especially fluffy ones.

Boru is coming up to 5 years old. He’s been with me since he was a 3-month-old puppy and I am his first and only owner. He is not “just a dog” to me – he’s been my companion through years of life, and I love him deeply. Boru is an extremely high-energy dog. He needs constant physical and mental stimulation – long walks, runs, play, structure, and engagement every single day. If you’re a “walk around the block” type of owner, this dog is not for you. He is a working dog so it be great to have someone with a need for him or constantly out and about with him. I now have a newborn baby, and my responsibilities have shifted in a way that means Boru is no longer getting the time, attention, and consistency he truly deserves. I can see that this is affecting him, and it’s not fair to ask him to adapt to a life that doesn’t suit his needs. This decision is not being made lightly or out of convenience. I’ve gone above and beyond for Boru for nearly five years, but loving him also means being honest about what’s best for him long-term. I am looking for a forever home, not a quick handover. Ideally, I’d like a potential new owner to: - Visit Boru few times - Spend time walking and bonding with him - Build trust before any rehoming takes place I will not rehome him unless I’m confident he’s going to a person who understands high-drive dogs and can genuinely give him the life he deserves. If you think you could be that person, and you’re willing to take the time to do this properly, please get in touch. (He has amazing recall, knows the fundementals of sit, lay, bed, stop, out, take.. etc and very friendly to female dogs but needs to be cautious with male dogs before introducing, especially intact male dogs. He himself is intact - should not be neutered as there are very negative effects on dogs of hes breed. Staying intact keeps hes testosterone high which helps keep hes bones and muscles strong)."

He has a fun-loving personality and brings a lot of joy to those around him. True to the breed, he is very people-orientated and thrives on companionship, attention, and being part of everyday life. He is also crate trained and is happy to relax in his bed as he needs. About him: • White Staffordshire Bull Terrier • Male • Very active and playful • Loves walks and outdoor time • Enjoys human company and affection • Full of character and typical Staffy charm He would suit a home where someone has the time and energy to meet his exercise needs and give him the love and structure he deserves. A home familiar with the Staffordshire Bull Terrier breed would be ideal, but the most important thing is a caring, responsible owner who understands and appreciates the breed. This is not a decision taken lightly. He is a much-loved dog and will only be rehomed to the right home. A rehoming fee will apply to ensure a genuine and suitable home.

About Jimmy Hes been a support dog for my adult sister with autism for the last 8 years. Jimmy is a loving and caring dog and a huge part of the family. He loves his walks and enjoys adult company. He would be happy in a home with no children or other dogs. We have brought our children to visit so he has been around them but he gets grumpy and prefers adult company. He has been known to growl at younger children (being honest) and although has gotten on with other dogs i believe he would be most happy and suited to maybe a single person or a couple. Maybe someone retired who would like a little walking companion. He is a sweet, afrectionate and happy boy. He loves the beach. He is 9 years old otherwise healthy with no medical issues. Hes been with our family for 8 years living with my mother and sister in north sheilds. We are very sad to be saying goodbye. We are trying our best to find the most loving forever home for him and also to find his human match to live out his days and enjoy life. As a family unfortuatly we coukd not keep him as we have two year old twins and two other children under 7 (mad house!) Plus a recue labrador of our own and that would be very stressful for jimmy. He is currently in Durham homed with a foster family but they have other dogs ans children and he isnt as happy or suited to thier family so we said we would take him back and hopefully find the right home.

But I have placed endorsements on his paperwork and although you may see them if you wish. He will NOT be going to his new home with them. We want him to go to a loving PET home. He is a friendly dog once he gets to know you, but is very shy around strangers. From a puppy he refused to walk on a lead. We have no idea why. We tried walking him with some of our other dogs, tried plying him with treats whilst on walks – but it was so stressful for him we stopped trying. He has never been socialised with children or cats – and I would think an adult home - perhaps an older couple with a sizeable garden would be best for him. He is clean inside the house and not destructive, and likes treats. He is a real carb fiend. His favourites are pasta, bread and chips. Yes we know its naughty but he loves them. He doesn’t like rice though. He has always been a lean Labrador – and drops weight quickly. He is a lovely dog – and is being re-homed through no fault of his own."

Hey guys, so these pups are only 2 weeks old! We have 1x male and 5x female. I want to start getting people interested so they can all go to the most loving forever home. All vaccines, health check and microchip will be done before you take home one of these gorgeous pups! Vaccination cost will be the deposit which will get done when it’s time to. About mother: She is the most lovable, caring, happy, outgoing, quirky best friend of mine. She is very adventurous and loves all kind of weather, activities, people and other dogs. She is an all rounder! Very lucky to have had her from birth so I’ve been with this dog since her first breath! She is being the best, loving, caring mumma for the pups so these pups are very well looked after by her and me. She is also 3/4 black lab and 1/4 Hungarian vizsla - I couldn’t as the mixed breed on the title. About father: He is the most loving, obedient, funny, caring husky. He is the typical Siberian husky with his quirks of talking, being silly and affectionate. He is excellent with people and other dogs. The most important ones.. the puppies: They are more husky like looking with their fluffy bodies, all black on the top half then have unique white prints on their bellies ( kinda marble like ) with either white socks/ toes or a mix of grey and white. They have just opened their eyes so awaiting eye colour. They all are walking like tanks, being loving and got some quirky personalities. They will be on a very high nutritional dried kibble to give them the best start of development. I am a very nutritional feeder to my dog as I believe that their diet makes all the difference to their mind and body. I will also do my best to get them toilet trained before they come to you. I have started early neurological development on all pups. This is a series of little interactions which help improve stimulation to overcome controlled stress. It benefits their later life situations for when things are new. This is only performed on age 3 days - 16 days as it’s a crucial time of their mind development. All pups have taken very well to it. Also, I will get them very well socialised with different experiences of interaction. I have started grooming them by cutting their nails to help mumma with feeding / to help their acceptance of toe touching / keeping their nails at a good length so you don’t need to worry about very sharp, long claws. Again, all pups have taken very well to this interaction. All pups will come with a bag of kibble, blanket, toy and have their pet medical book. More photos will be uploaded as they get older. Be the first in line to add one of these gorgeous puppies to your family! ( I have only named them for my own purposes so you can choose your own when satisfied with your fluff ball ) I will respond to any deeper conversations asap. We can have a video call before seeing them in person to make sure you’re happy with everything :) Price : - £110 deposit for their first vet trip. (have spoken to the vets to get the price / aware of them coming in) this includes, wormer, first dose of vaccinations, microchipped and health check. - £925 for the puppy"

His first owner neglected him and he was locked in a room. His second owner (my brother) rescued him however his housing was not suitable and the landlord threatened to kick him out. My brother’s genius idea was to give him to the RSPCA however asked if I could house him for a week so that he could show his landlord the dog was gone. I took him in however couldn’t let him go to RSPCA as he is just good a dog to go to kennel. I had someone take Winter and within less than 2 weeks he returned him saying he can’t handle him. Please understand Winter is still a puppy he does and will have puppy brain. He is a good boy however has bouts of excitement. He is not a Labrador or pretty little cuddly dog. He will need to be looked after accordingly. He is good with kids and other pets however he doesn’t understand he is big. Absolutely no breeders, must have experience with similar dog breads. Expect questions. Please don’t bother asking for reduced price if you can’t afford the price you can’t afford him. Lastly Winter is not a trial. The person who took him 2 weeks ago told me he had large dogs. Spoke all the right stuff and then called me a day after he took him saying his not sure this is going to work because Winter wouldn’t respond to his name and wouldn’t come back. Please I stress again If you don’t understand the breed don’t enquire."

We are selling him due to personal circumstances which were not forseen. We would like him to go to a big family home not a sole person, with a garden and an active outdoor lifestyle which he can be involved in as he is not a lazy dog and needs physical and mental workouts. It would be ideal if he could live with another dog of similar breed. He is very friendly and playful with other small dogs and children but doesn't enjoy being left alone-WOULD SUIT SOMEONE WHO IS HOME THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME Walks well on a retractable lead and harness. Outdoor toilet trained but he also is puppy pad trained and we leave one at the back door when we are out which he will use. He is crate trained and sleeps all night in his crate with some towels (until he is out of his teething stage as he chewed his first dog bed) Loves walks, toys, treats and chicken and rice! He is fully vaccinated (2 jabs) and microchipped-new owner will need to register him at their new address (this costs £30) He is wormed and flead-this will need to be done monthly per age recommendation. He has been health checked by the vet with no concerns. We are selling him with all of the below included in the price (well over £125 worth of things): Harness, retractable lead and coat worth £20 Medium sized crate worth £30 Dog grooming hair cutting kit worth £15 Metal food and water bowl in stand Automated timed battery operated 2 dish feeder worth £40 Car seat belt and back seat hammock cover worth £20 Toys The buyer will need to be sure about owning a dog as we couldn't accept him back.

Somewhere she will be the only pet as she doesn’t get along much with many other dogs due to having trauma in the past from another dog hurting her. However always ready for her walks! She is an extremely loving affectionate Daxie, always ready for snuggly cuddles. Her playful side will come out when she feels secure. Great with children. She is crate trained and goes to sleep in there , she is comfortable and happy with going in there as it is her safe space. Once she trusts you , you will become her world. Unfortunately I haven’t had her for too long as my daughter has gotten severe allergies from having her around so it’s a must to have to rehome her. It really pains me to have to be reselling her as she has been such an angel to us. I’m really wanting her to go to her permanent home with a lot of love. Someone who is home majority of the time and that values companionship, cuddles and emotional connection. She will come with her crate, food, toys, blanket and outfits. Basically everything you need to start off with her is included. The little dog has so much love to give. In the right home with the right person she will thrive and repay that kindness with loyalty, affection and devotion. If you feel you might be the calm, loving presence she’s been waiting for , please get in touch and tell us about yourself and the home you could offer for her."

We have had him since he was 8 weeks old and he has been raised in a loving home environment. He is a loving, playful, and affectionate dog with a big personality. Like many sausage dogs, he is very loyal and protective of his owners and forms strong bonds with the people he trusts. He enjoys playtime, attention, and being close to his humans. Barney is good around other dogs but is not suited to a home with young children, as he can become overwhelmed by them. He would thrive best in an adult-only home or with older, dog-savvy children. He is mostly toilet trained. When he has regular access outside he does very well, but he can have small accidents if he is unable to get outdoors in time. We currently use doggy nappies during those periods, which has worked well for him. Barney needs a home where someone will be around most of the time. When left alone for long periods, he can become distressed and destructive. Sadly, our circumstances have changed and we are now working longer hours. We cannot bear the thought of him being left alone and unhappy, which is why we are making this very difficult decision. Barney is: • Fully microchipped • Fully up to date with all vaccinations and routine medication • In excellent health with no known medical issues He will come with his fully fitted harness and all relevant information. We are looking for a committed, loving home where his needs can be fully met and where he can continue to thrive. This decision has not been taken lightly, and Barney’s welfare is our absolute priority."

He has lovely tendencies, very playful, loving, energetic and cheeky. He has grown up with two other dogs and three young children so very used to a bus home dynamic. He is up to date with jabs and has been flea’d and wormed. As they’re a challenging breed to toilet train, he is 95% of the way there but is prone to accidents. A busy household is likely not helping his training! At the moment we’re just too busy to give him the love and attention he deserves so would love to find him a new home where he can be the centre of attention.

They honest truths about him He loves ALL the attention ( one of the main reasons for rehoming ) we have our older dog , 3 children and 2 cats we have to divide our attentions between aswell as both working full time , he can sometimes chew things up if left lying around and unattended for long periods of time , we usually find a nice big yaker bone keeps him very occupied He has on occasion had a wee accident indoors if he is not in his crate and hasn't been let out within a cpl hours but he will generally walk to the back door to let you know he needs to go He loves his crate and will willingly take himself off to it when he knows it's bed time , or as/when needed He's very playful but doesnt understand he weighs 24kg and can't be held like a baby ! He doesn't like long walks at all .. 20 minutes at a time is more than enough He doesnt like car journeys too much they stress him out He loves his cuddly toys and a good nose scratch and has a clean bill of health. Hes recently been castrated. A decision we made to avoid a home that may have only wanted to use him to stud !! He lives with 3 children aged 5-16 and is soft as anything with them , plays well with other dogs and also loves our cats although he does like to pin them down on occasion and again weighing 24kg isnt ideal for the kitty unless they play back like ours do He comes from a brilliant blood line , is Micro chipped, up to date with vaccinations and has a diet of royal canin dry food , mixed with a raw meat diet to ensure he stays in good health and weight range He'll want to follow you everywhere you go ( yes even to the toilet if you allow it ) 😆 The non - negotiables We will want to do a home check , to ensure a clean loving household for him , and would like to know your home dynamics to ensure it will work for Gerald. Meeting him before officially taking him is a must to make sure his excited temperament is right for you, and that he takes to you aswell . He is the main priority here and we're willing to keep him with us until the right family come along , he will not just go to anyone , anywhere ."

While he enjoys play and walks, he’s just as happy to sit beside you and cuddle up for some quiet time. He would suit a home where someone has more time to continue his training and enjoy his affectionate nature.

He’s now around 4 years old. About Flower: • Age: Approximately 4 years • Size: Small • Colour: Foxy-like, with a golden-red coat and a beautiful, fluffy tail (like a flower – which inspired his name!) • Temperament: Very intelligent, friendly, playful, and affectionate. He loves company and is full of personality. • Alertness: Flower is a sharp listener with a strong sense of smell and hearing. He is very protective of the home and quickly alerts you to unusual noises or strangers, making him an excellent little guardian of the property. • Health: Fully vaccinated and regularly treated for fleas, worms, and other parasites • Behaviour: Although he is lovely with adults and children, he does not get along with cats and other dogs. He was one year old when he became part of our family, likely he was not socialised. He is used to live indoors and outdoors (garden with kennel) and go for daily walks leashed. We are heartbroken to part with him as we are moving abroad, so we are looking for a caring family who will welcome him as a new household member and continue to provide the love and attention he deserves. Location: East Ham (E6, London) Adoption Fee: £250 to help ensure he goes to a serious and committed home (they cost £1000+). We may ask a few welfare questions and request a short form with your contact details at collection. We might follow up later or request a photo to ensure Flower is settling in well and living in a safe environment. Please let me know if Flower would fit your home well. * Available an outdoor wood large house for a garden, built for him, which will let it go for £250. Building it personalised cost us £450, and he loves it. It's heavy, and it requires a van to transport it. Kind regards, Carlos"

We currently have 5 boys and two girls available Both parents are our much loved family pets so you are welcome to meet them and have some time with them, they are both sweet, loving and very playful . This is their first litter of puppies and we are not planning another, we are not professional breeders so not interested in making lots profit, but we are interested in finding people who have lots of time and love to invest? Deer-Doodles are quite rare, they offer all the cute cuddly traits and strong genetics from the poodle, that all doodles have, with the elegance and grace of the deerhound long-dog. The Deer-Doodle puppies are all black with individual splashes of white on their chests and bellies and some have some white toes, they may turn lighter over time as their mother was born black and is now silver? Both parents have coats that don’t moult or shed hair, Grace needs to be clipped every 6 weeks or so, Torren has a rough woolly coat and needs grooming a couple of times each week with a pin brush. Torren was blond as a puppy but is now silver-grey. Our puppies will be raised in our family home , with their parents, where all the commotion goes on, they will used to all household noises and smells. Each puppy will have their 1st vaccination, health check, and microchipping, they will be wormed every 2 weeks till 8 weeks old. We welcome home visits from 4weeks old (4th February) as by then they start showing their individual characters When you have chosen your boy or girl there is a £350 non refundable reservation fee with the balance to be paid prior to the collection date. The puppies will leave with a blanket with mums scent on, and a puppy pack with information on their journey to date. We feed the parents on raw food diets and plan on weaning the pups to the same, as we feel that this is the most healthy option as we don’t believe in feeding dogs carbohydrates. The puppies will be ready to leave around the 4th March 2026 If you are interested or have any questions please get in touch for more information. Texting or WhatsApp is best we can then arrange a mutually convenient time for a chat? Many Thanks for your interest and we look forward to hearing from you."

We brought him home from his original family when he was around 7–8 weeks old. He originally had many siblings. He is microchipped, neutered, and vaccinated annually. He is a very lively and energetic boy. He has a bit of a husky personality; He loves to chew on toys, so when he's alone, we use a playpen or cage to keep him out of the furniture, just in case. There are children in our home, so he is used to living with kids and adapts well to a family with children. However, he is not good with other dogs. Whenever we go for walks, he shows strong aggression towards other dogs. He understands simple commands such as “sit,” “wait,” and “down.” He is very protective of the home — when a stranger approaches the door, he will bark once as a warning. He does not bark excessively. He will only become alert when strangers approach the house, or occasionally when friends visit, as he is initially cautious with unfamiliar people. However, after a short time of playing and interaction, he becomes very friendly. We have two children and the cat at home. Steki loves playing with children, although the cat does not get along with him. His previous family also had children. He receives annual vaccinations and health checks at the veterinary clinic, and I also administer parasite prevention treatment every month. I feel very ashamed and heartbroken to let him go. However, due to being made redundant by my previous company, I am currently not financially able to continue caring for him. My former employer has not paid any redundancy pay and still owes me several months of salary, and I am now in the process of legal action. A large cage will also be included (Refer to the last picture) and the dry food storage box."

Only asking for an adoption fee to ensure he goes to the right home. It’s with a heavy heart I am looking to rehome my families dog due to finding out he was not being cared for correctly since returning back home. He is microchipped and neutered. He is nearly 5 years old but still acts like a puppy. When he is outside of his unhealthy environment he is a great dog, previous trainer loved him as well as groomers. He is very anxious and barks meeting new people but doesn’t show aggression. Lived with a cat but has not liked any others. He has been great with submissive dogs that ignore him, due to him being bit by a dog before whilst out on a walk he doesn’t like dogs trying to dominate him or invade his space but will initiate play with a calm dog. I just want him to go somewhere where he can heal and have the life he deserves and be properly cared for as he is the sweetest boy, just in the wrong environment. I will not just be giving him to anyone, he would ideally suit a family or a person that can give him the time love and attention he deserves for him to really thrive. I will absolutely need updates as well as wanting to see him every so often whether that’s every couple months or so. Please know, the situation was out of my control and I am trying to do what is best for him, seeing as i can not take him on from my family due to me working with dogs full time."

Thank you all I have had so much attention but this is not a straightforward sale I have 3 disabled children that would be devastated if I let Rosie go which is why I will only let her go to someone close and that they will be allowed to visit or take her out, which also means u’s will have a built in dog sitter 😉 would suit a single person looking for a companion that is easy to care for 🤗 thank you for reading."

We apologise for any inconvenience.,£850,"Pinchbeck, Lincolnshire",Rottweiler,Mixed Litter,8 weeks,Now,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Karina,5 days ago,"💛 Rottweiler × French Mastiff Puppies (“Rottie Bordeaux”) – Born 24th November 💛 💷 £850 each | £150 non-refundable deposit to secure Our beautiful girl Athena has welcomed her very first litter of stunning puppies on 24th November. The puppies are a powerful yet affectionate mix of their parents, often referred to as Rottie Bordeaux, combining strength, loyalty, calm confidence, and an incredibly loving nature. These puppies are being raised inside our family home, alongside both mum and dad, and with children, so they are growing up well socialised, confident, and used to everyday household life, noises, and affection. From day one, they have been handled with love, patience, and care. About the Parents: Mother – Athena Athena is a purebred Rottweiler from champion bloodlines. She is an exceptional example of the breed: *Calm, loving, and incredibly patient. *Naturally nurturing and gentle, especially with children. *Confident without aggression. *Intelligent, eager to please, and emotionally intuitive. Rottweilers are known for their loyalty, steadiness, and devotion to their family, and Athena truly embodies all of this. She is a wonderful mother and an amazing family dog. Father – Thor Thor is a French Mastiff (Dogue de Bordeaux) with the biggest heart. *Insanely loyal and deeply bonded to his people. *A gentle giant who thinks he’s a lap dog. *Fantastic with children. *Protective of his family while remaining calm and stable. He may look intimidating, but he is a true softie. Relaxed, affectionate, and emotionally sensitive to those around him. His protective instincts are balanced by his calm nature, which is exactly what you want in a family guardian. Both parents are healthy, active, muscular, and well cared for, and can be seen with the puppies. About the Puppies: These puppies are already showing the best of both breeds: *Strong, chunky builds with expressive faces. *Calm but confident temperaments. *Naturally affectionate and people oriented. *Curious, alert, and intelligent. They will grow into loyal, devoted companions who form deep bonds with their families. This mix is ideal for someone looking for a dog that is both a loving family member and a natural protector. Because of their breeding, these puppies will need: *Consistent training. *Clear boundaries. *Love, time, and commitment. In return, they will give unmatched loyalty and companionship. Raised With Care & Responsibility: These puppies are not kennel raised or mass bred. They are part of our home and our daily life. Before leaving for their new homes, each puppy will: ✅Receive first vaccinations ✅Get microchipped ✅Be health-checked Each puppy will also go home with a puppy pack, including: *A blanket with mum’s scent (to ease the transition). *Food they are used to. *A toy. This helps them settle more calmly and comfortably into their new family. A Bit About Us: I am an absolute dog person, the kind who can’t walk past a dog without saying hello. I grew up with a Staffy who meant the world to me, and when I lost that dog, I couldn’t bring myself to get another for many years. It honestly felt like cheating. Athena and Thor are my first dogs since then, and they are deeply loved members of our family. This litter has been planned, cared for, and raised with intention, love, and responsibility. Finding the right homes matters more to me than a quick sale. I want these puppies to go to people who understand the responsibility of large, intelligent breeds and who are ready to invest in training, structure, and lifelong care. Homes We’re Looking For: These puppies will be best suited to: *Loving, committed families or individuals. *Homes that understand large breeds. *Owners willing to provide training, time, and affection. If you’re looking for a dog that will grow up to be: ✨ Loyal. ✨ Protective without being aggressive. ✨ Incredible with children. ✨ A true family companion. …then one of these puppies may be perfect for you."

She is being rehomed due to personal circumstances and not because of anything she has done wrong. Pennie is up to date with her vaccinations and microchipped, though she is not neutered. She is a very friendly, gentle dog who lives happily with children and cats. However, she would be best suited to a home where she can be the only dog, as she finds other dogs overwhelming. As you’d expect from her breed, Pennie comes with plenty of hair and some dribble, so her new owner must be prepared for that side of big-dog life. She will thrive with someone who has experience handling large breeds and understands their needs. Pennie is extremely nervous and easily frightened, and as a result she is very reactive on walks. This is something her new owner must be willing to manage patiently and compassionately, ideally with experience of anxious or reactive dogs and a calm, structured approach. Our priority is simply finding her a safe, loving, and suitable home. In line with guidelines and to ensure a clear transfer of ownership, Pennie’s microchip details will need to be updated to the new owner’s information prior to or at the time of rehoming. We will provide the microchip number so this can be done by the new owner directly; there is a transfer fee of approximately £25, payable to the microchip database. We are committed to finding Pennie a safe, understanding, and experienced home where she can feel secure and loved. If you feel you could offer Pennie the right environment and the time she needs to settle, please get in touch for a chat."

My coat is very fluffy, soft and completely white and I need to shed my coat every six months or so to help me acclimatise to the changing seasons. I am an intact Siberian Husky. My most favourite things to do in life is running and walking I have so much energy but I do love to nap lots during the day. I love spending time with my family and being close to people who love me. My favourite toys are balls and ropes which I enjoy playing with quietly on my own. I love attention from big children but small children scare me when they won’t leave me alone. I am a very happy husky and very friendly with lots of people and cats once I get to know them, but small doggies scare me and big male doggies are scary too. I really don’t like the dark and I hate being left on my own this makes me feel scared anxious and insecure. I love routine it makes me feel secure and safe. I am a very good boy I know that I have to ask to go outside to use the toilet and not to do this in the house. I know that I am not allowed to climb on the furniture or chew anything that isn’t my toys. 🏡 My home needs to be spacious with a big secure garden. 👶 No small children, but big children are fine. 🐶 No small dogs or male dogs ⛔️ No weed smokers or drug users. ⛔️ No shouting, or heavy handling. I really need someone who knows about husky’s and how to train and take care of me. I will thrive from positive reinforcement and praise. I have one request please do not shout at me because you will scare me and I won’t listen to you, but if you ask me nicely and make everything exciting I will follow your commends all day long. I already know lots of commands like sit, paw, lie down, stay, leave, off, down, bed, walk, and up. I have already been through a very tough time, I have been re-homed twice before through no fault of my own. Please only agree to take me home if you have serious thought about it and you are not going to give me away again, I don’t think my heart will take it. If you give me 100% effort and love I promise to reward you a million times over. I deserve a chance and a forever home with kind and loving people. If you want to take me home you need to convince my current family that you are the best people for me and can give me a better life with you. We will be willing to discuss price for the right home."

This is mums first litter and the dedication and care she has shown to them has been second to none, they truly are an exceptional litter.

Unfortunately, I am currently in a crisis and due to no fault of his own, Bodhi is looking for a new home. He has been around cats before, but due to his young age and size he gets very excitable so wouldn’t be recommended. He has never been around young children before but with some care, love, attention and boundaries, I believe he will be okay around older children (13+). I have had him since he left his litter as a young pup. He is house trained and doesn’t have accidents in the house, is up to date with all vaccinations including kennel cough. He will pull on the lead but with some time and guidance I believe this can be easily rectified. Once off the lead he is very good, he doesn’t go more than 15/20ft in front before waiting for you to catch up and will avoid other dogs if you tell him he can’t play with them. When out on his walks, his favourite thing in the world will be sticks. He does jump up the first few times with meeting people because he just wants to give lots of kisses, but when he knows he doesn’t have to fight for your attention he’s very chilled and quite a couch potato. He does well on car journeys, but the longest he’s spent on a car journey is only 30 minutes, one way. He has been very well loved and I am absolutely broken that it has come to this.

He's 2 1/2 years old, neutered and up to date on vaccinations and flea/worm treatment. I'll be as honest as I can here as I want his next home to be forever. We bought him from someone a year ago, not being told some of the issues he has. Overall he's a very sweet boy, loves cuddles, toys, rides in the car and walks. Unfortunately he's very reactive on meeting other dogs and despite our best efforts he's no better. He appears to be very aggressive however if anyone allows their dog next to him, within a few minutes he just wants to play, I think he's just scared of the unknown as he does have a couple of doggy friends. He's very similar with people, he tends to be very stand offish until he gets time to meet them and then he's fine. He loves to be off lead and play with a ball, however as he is the way he is we can only do this at enclosed dog spaces when he's alone so he could do with a garden to play in. Unfortunately after everything we've tried I'm just unable to cope with him out on walks and can't help but feel he'll be better off with someone who can work with him or an environment that suits him better, perhaps someone with knowledge of the breed.
